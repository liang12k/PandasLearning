NumPy Basics: Array, Vectorized computation

standard syntax:
import numpy as np

** tools for integrating code written in C, C++, Fortran

 ^ from ecosystem POV, NumPy provide easy-to-use C API
easy to pass data to external libs written in low-level
language & external libs to return data to Python as
NumPy arrays.

::: therefore, Python wraps legacy C/C++/Fortran
codebases - giving them a dynamic, easy-to-use interface
